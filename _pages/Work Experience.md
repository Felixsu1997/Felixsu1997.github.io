* **Unikorn Semiconductor Corporation，Process integration Engineer* / Hsinchu  2023/7 – present
======
*AOI/SEM/DOE/EDA/SAS/SEM/FMEA/FIB/VBA/Python/Yield improvement/root cause analysis of defects/device physics theory/optical measurement instruments
  1.	Improved product yield for customers, responsible for products including BAW filter components and micro LEDs, primarily enhancing abnormal appearance and real-time monitoring of electrical frequency. 
  2.	Process improvement: Observed in the SPC chart that the rework rate for photoresist stripping was as high as 50%. Collaborated with the etching team to optimize the photoresist stripping method, reducing the rework rate to 12%.
  3.	Process improvement: Introduced ASH processes and optimized cleaning procedures for BAW filters, reducing defect occurrence rate from 70% to 10%.
  4.	Process improvement: Adjusted ICP process parameters and equipment cleaning methods for uLEDs, reducing walkway contamination from 80% to 30%.
  5.	Continuous improvement of the New Tape Out SOP: Collaborated with the module team to adjust SS4 parameters for cleaning optimization, enhancing product yield by 80%.
  6.	Data analysis: Utilized SAS analysis software and combined it with machine learning to quickly identify feature values for improvements, increasing work efficiency by 70%.
  7.	Data analysis: Collaborated with IT to implement AI, using Python and the TensorFlow framework to develop a CNN for automatic defect type recognition with an accuracy of approximately 80%.
  8.	Customer returns analysis: Verified incoming micro LED products using EFC & Chroma penetrative inspection equipment (such as X-ray/Tera Hertz/IR), identified abnormal incoming materials, and set inspection standards, saving the company about 6 million per year.
	Database maintenance: Maintained the KLA database and completed online courses in Linux & DBA during after-hours, earning completion certificates.
	External Training Program: Process and Equipment Overview from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University
