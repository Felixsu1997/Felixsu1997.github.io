* My name is Felix,
A graduate of National Central University. During my studies, I participated in numerous projects such as building near-zero energy buildings using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and spatiotemporal data analysis techniques, simulating the shortest rescue routes in fire scenarios using XR and VR, and enrolling in corporate internships. I made the most of every moment to continually accumulate knowledge that I lacked. My thesis topic was the prediction of future growth in electric vehicles and overall electricity consumption using machine learning. The courses I took, such as Environmental Spatiotemporal Data Analysis and Data Visualization, Deep Learning Analysis and Applications in Information Management, and Practical Environmental Disaster Monitoring, have helped me become proficient in Python, Arduino, Revit, CAD software, and have given me a basic understanding of fundamental circuits and electronics.
* Currently, my work is primarily focused on the semiconductor industry. During my spare time, I proactively enroll in external training courses such as the Introduction to Semiconductor Processes and Equipment and Introduction to Semiconductor Devices. I also take online courses after work to continuously improve my skills. My academic background has provided me with a diverse range of tools for data analysis, enabling me to identify issues more quickly and accurately. My work experience has equipped me with quick decision-making capabilities in process improvement, logical reasoning, yield enhancement, team communication, defect analysis, and New Tape Out SOPs. I look forward to bringing these experiences and skills to your company, continuously challenging myself in a new environment, and achieving higher career goals.
